Recommendations to follow:

1. There is no default return type in Java. 
   In java it is compulsory to specify the return type
   
2. Default access specifier: "default". It is not public.
3. Write methods with return statements.
4. Do not write any business logic in main().
5. Objects can be created in any method, not limited to main().
6. Do not write any business logic without method, it should be 
   a part of the method.
   
7. Method names should have tasks connected with some Nouns
   Eg. driveCar()
   
8. Do not create unnecessary local variables. They are termed as code smells.
9. Follow camelCase
10. Constants should be capital
11. variables should be lower case and nouns.
12. Only one class from entire project contains psvm 
13. Reference names should come from reference of class name
14. Always have default constructor and parameterized constructor(wherever possible) class
15. In parameterized constructor, the arguments should match with the name of instant variables
16. Every instant variable should be prefix by this keyword
 
 
 
Identifiers : variable names 
   should start with letter or underscore
   no special characters apart from _,$
   keywords cannot be used as identifier 
   no white space 
   
   
 
Keywords : predefined words having some meaning to compilers
 
 
Hands on: 
if.else
switch.case
for loop
while loop
do while
break
continue


Rules for Constructor: 
1. Name of constructor should match exactly to the name of class 
2. Constructor should not have any return type. Not even void.
3. Do not call the constructor explicitly.
